# neroksi client

This is a client app for the neroksi - your learning community.

## ✔️ Requirements

This app is built by utilizing [Expo](https://expo.dev) framework. If you haven't installed Expo on your local environment, run `npm install --global expo-cli` to access Expo command line tools.

## 🚀 Getting started

*Please notice, that in order to use this app, you currently need to run [neroksi-api](https://github.com/juhoniinikoski/neroksi-app/tree/main/neroksi-api) locally. See [instructions](https://github.com/juhoniinikoski/neroksi-app/tree/main/neroksi-api) for getting started with the API.*

1. Clone this repository and run `npm install` in the `client` directory.

2. Run `npm start` to start the app. After the app has started you should be able to access the [Metro](https://facebook.github.io/metro/) bundler at http://localhost:19002.

## 🔑 Authentication

To test the app, you need to authenticate. You can use the test user with username of either "pekka", "elina", "matti", "johndoe" or "leeroyjenkins". All those users have the super secret password "password".

The access token coming with authentication will be stored to your simulator. All access tokens expire after **seven days** after which authentication must be redone.

## ❓ About

- **Is this app already in production?** No it is not. This is currently a one man project, which is still lacking crucial features. Hope to take this into production as soon as possible 🤙
